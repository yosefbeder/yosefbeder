Hi, I'm Yosef.

I'm a *high school student*.

I've been coding for about *three years now*.

Recently I've been learning *Computer Science*, in particular *Algorithms* and *Computer Organization*.

I can code in *JavaScript*, *Rust*, *Java*, and *Python*.

I have some experience with *Front-End Development*.

I also know about *Compilers* and even created a [simple programming language](https://github.com/yosefbeder/qatam) (not yet complete... and won't be ever).

Programming is one of the things I enjoy the most, but I think it will always be a hobby.
