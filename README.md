Hi, I'm Yosef.

I'm a high school student in my second year.

I've been coding for about two years now.

I started programming by learning front-end development.

At the beginning of this year, I decided to learn programming languages.

I'm good at using Rust (wrote [a programming language](https://github.com/yosefbeder/qatam) with it) and JavaScript.

I also use Python occasionally for writing scripts.
