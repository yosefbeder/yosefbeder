### ✍️ About me
Hi, I'm Yosef.

I'm a high school student based in Egypt.

I've been learning to code since January 19, 2020.

### 👀 Interests
I'm interested in frontend, programming languages, physics, languages (English and French), and reading books.

### 🌱 Learning
In the last three months, I directed my attention towards topics related to computer science.

I started by taking [Computer Science 101: Master the Theory Behind Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-science-101-master-the-theory-behind-programming/).

Then, I decided to learn Rust to understand lower-level programming so I read [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

Then, I decided to create a programming language after listening to [Building software for yourself](https://changelog.com/podcast/455) episode, So I started reading [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

Before that, I was learning frontend.
